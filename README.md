# Deep learning for genetic prediction of complex traits

This repository houses and documents the codes used to train and test polygenic scores (PGS) of simulated traits under various settings using machine learning and deep learning methods. 

- **sparSNP**: Scripts that train and test genetic scores of simulated traits using the elastic net method (implemented through SparSNP).

- **Prsice2**: Scripts that train and test genetic scores of simulated traits using the P+T method (implemented through Prsice2).

- **MLP Talos**: Scripts that train and test genetic scores of simulated traits using the MLP method (network structure and other hyperparameters search through Talos).
