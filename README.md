This repository houses and documents the codes used to train and test polygenic scores (PGS) of simulated traits under various settings using machine learning and deep learning methods. 


# Deep learning for genetic prediction of complex traits


- **sparSNP**: Scripts that train and test genetic scores of simulated traits using the elastic net method (implemented through SparSNP).

- **Prsice2**: Scripts that train and test genetic scores of simulated traits using the P+T method (implemented through Prsice2).
